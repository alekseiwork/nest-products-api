# NestJS Products API

A simple example backend built with **NestJS** and **PostgreSQL**.  
This project demonstrates a basic CRUD API for products with optional sorting and filtering. It's intended as a **learning/demo project**, not a production-ready app. No advanced styling or frontend is included.

## Features

- CRUD operations for products
- Sorting and filtering by fields (name, brand, price, color, country)
- PostgreSQL database via TypeORM
- Simple import endpoints for CSV/URL (example only)
